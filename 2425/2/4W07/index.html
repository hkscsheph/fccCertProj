        <li><span class="bold">2016:</span> In James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the
          Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers
          went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.The Cavaliers made several moves to build a
          championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota
          Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a "Big Three" with James, Love and
          Irving.The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the
          Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in
          franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.It was also
          Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the
          so-called Cleveland sports curse.
