      Named after neighbouring area Chelsea, they compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.
      Founded in 1905, the team play their home games at Stamford Bridge.[4] The club won their first major honour, the

      Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022.

      Chelsea is one of five clubs and the first English club to have won all three pre-1999 main European club
      competitions, the "European Treble" of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and
      UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League.[5] They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice.
      They are the only London club to have won the Champions League and the Club World Cup.[6] Domestically, the club

      club in English football.

      The club has rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a historic rivalry with Leeds
