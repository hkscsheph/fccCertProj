          Chongyue, the elder brother of landship residents Nian, Dusk, and Ling. He has a close relationship with
          government organizations such as the Yanese Ministry of War and the Sui Regulator. Previously served as a
          martial arts instructor at the nomadic city Yumen, a position which he has resigned from. He came to Rhodes
          Island to visit his family, and after a round of audits, he is temporarily residing onboard the landship as a
          visitor. Chongyue possesses rich combat experience and has provided Rhodes Island his unique combat
          suggestions. However, as requested by Dr. Kal'tsit, Chongyue rarely participates in missions directly.

        <h4>background story</h4>
        <li>
          The eldest of all "siblings" of Sui the Yanese Feranmut, Shuo is the first who obtained human conscience
          following His fragmentation and the one who sought to find his own meaning of life in this mortal realm. While
          witnessing countless wars and bloodsheds, he was also amazed by Yan's age-old vicissitude that still retains
          the empire's might. In order to seek the true meaning of "wu", whether it be conflict for war or martial arts
          for peace, as a human being, he concealed his Feranmut nature inside his magical sword and remodeled his body
          into a true man as "Chongyue," a pseudonym given by his deceased comrade and an elegy describing his eternal
          mission and his amazement on the mortal realm.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now being a human, Chongyue volunteered to serve the imperial court as the Imperial Guards' grandmaster. For
          ages, he has been quietly defending the garrison city of Yumen from the threats of the northern Collapsals and
          the surviving Feranmuts. As an excellent martial artist who masters all kung fu and military philosophy across
          Yan, he also spreads his knowledge to the soldiers through real-life combat and scrolls archived by them.
          Despite his achievements, however, the immortal grandmaster could only witness his dear comrades and disciples
          fading into dust one by one. He is now tired of eternal conflicts but wishes to seek inner peace inside
          himself, hence his eventual retirement after requesting it to the imperial court.
          <br>
          <br>
          As Sui's revival draws nigh thanks to the insidious plot of several factions within the imperial court such as
          the notorious Shanhaizhong, Chongyue too embarks on his mission to defy his destiny together with his
          entrusted sister Ling and his younger siblings Nian and Dusk. In the meantime, he has to stop some of his
          wicked siblings, notably his "Second Brother," and other Feranmuts like Ya to accelerate the plan. While he
          prefers tranquility, he won't hesitate to stop all conflicts using his blazing, iron fists, just as an ancient
          proverb goes: "A man could only stop war by weapons."

          Chongyue is one of the protagonists in Where Vernal Winds Will Never Blow.
