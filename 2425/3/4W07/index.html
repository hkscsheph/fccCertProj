      <p>The stephen curry</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall
          pick in the 2009 NBA draft.During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of
          general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,was promoted in his place; Riley
          drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.</li>

      <p>The first champion</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies
          in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference
          Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland
          Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After
          Golden State fell behind 2-1 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season,
          replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death
          Lineup) helped turn the series around.The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named
          Finals MVP.Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981-82.</li>

      <p>The finals</p>

        <li>The Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland
          Cavaliers.The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a
          comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and
          Curry was ejected from Game Six.In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the
          distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.</li>

      <p>Kd became a traitor</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016-17 regular-season
          record of 67-15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12-0, defeating the
          Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors
          against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three
          consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4-1 in the Finals, and their 16-1 playoff
          record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.After the Warriors announced that
          they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President
          Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.The team still planned to travel to Washington,D.C. to "celebrate
          equality, diversity and inclusion." Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the
          National Museum of African-American History and Culture.</li>

      <p>warrios in 2018</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a
          2017–18 regular season record of 58–24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4–1, the Warriors came
          up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3–2
          disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors staved off elimination and came back to win the
          series 4–3, winning the Western Conference for the 4th straight year. The 2018 Finals pitted the Warriors
          against the Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season; this marked the first time in NBA history that the
          same two teams had met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their
          second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.On August 30,
          2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers
          for Sports Illustrated,USA Today,The Wall Street Journal,and the New York Daily News[122] described the
          Warriors as a dynasty. The Warriors returned to the Finals the following year and lost 4–2 to the Toronto
          Raptors.</li>

      <p>worst year of warrios</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors played their first regular-season game at Chase Center on October 24, 2019, in a 141–122 loss
          to the Los Angeles Clippers.During their very next home game, on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Curry
          broke his hand in a collision, requiring surgery that was expected to keep him out of action for at least 3
          months. This, along with Thompson's injury rehab keeping him out the entire year, sent the Warriors into a
          downward spiral from which they never recovered. However, they saw second-round pick Eric Paschall, two-way
          player Damion Lee, and training camp pickup Marquese Chriss establish themselves as rotation players. At the
          trade deadline, the Warriors traded Russell, 2018 first-round pick Jacob Evans, and recent acquisition Omari
          Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, a top-3 protected first-round pick, and
          a second-round pick. Curry returned for one game on March 5 before the season was suspended due to the
          COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended
          their 2019–20 season with a league-worst record of 15–50.</li>

      <p>Championship glory</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the
          playoffs for the first time since the 2018–19 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver
          Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors
          advanced to their twelfth NBA Finals in franchise history after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western
          Conference Finals, 4–1. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics
          4–2. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.</li>

      <p>Injury struggles</p>
      <ul>
        <li>However, despite the team's average performance throughout the season, the San Francisco-based squad
          displayed remarkable determination and resilience. They ultimately finished with the sixth seed and a 44–38
          record, qualifying for the last direct playoff spot. In the playoffs, they defeated the third-seeded
          Sacramento Kings in seven games, despite the Kings being up 2–0, to advance to the Western Conference
          semifinals. However, they then lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games. This marked the
          first time since 2014 that the Warriors lost in the playoffs prior to reaching the Finals, and the first
          playoff series loss against a Western Conference opponent under Steve Kerr.</li>

      <p>2024 season</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Warriors struggled as the season started, as after a 5–1 start they lost 7 of their next 8 games,
          including a 6-game losing skid and 14–23 in games between December and January, tumbling to a 19–24 record.
          The month of February saw a resurgence for the Warriors, as they went 11–3 and achieved a 32–27 record by
          March. Despite initial struggles, however, they ended March and started April going 9–1 in their next ten
          games and achieved a 44–35 record. On April 4, the Warriors secured their eleventh winning season in twelve
          seasons. On April 7, after the Warriors beat the Jazz, and the Rockets lost to the Mavericks, they secured a
          spot in the postseason, with the NBA play-in tournament for the first time since 2021. They improved upon
          their 44–38 record from last year after a win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite this, on April 16, the
          Warriors were eliminated in the first stage of postseason by the Sacramento Kings in the Play-In Tournament,
          losing 118–94. This would also become the final season that the Splash Brothers would play together, as Klay
          Thompson would leave the team in a sign-and-trade entering free agency on July 6.</li>

          second-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. The Warriors took an early 3–1 series lead,
          but the Rockets won the next two games to force a game 7. The Warriors won game 7, clinching an appearance in
          the conference semifinals where they will face the sixth-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves.</li>
