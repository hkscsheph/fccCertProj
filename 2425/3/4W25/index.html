        History
      </header>
      <p>Mr. Ephraim Hertzano originally made his living selling toothbrushes and other plastic accessories as well as
        cosmetics. The game started as a brilliant idea that had occurred to Mr. Hertzano, living in Romania, when
        card-playing was outlawed under the Communist regime.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hertzano envisioned playing a game that would use small tiles instead of cards to play, a game that could
        be played by young and old alike, and that had no ties to any language or religion. He wanted to create a game
        that would bring people together and one day change the world’s leisure time. He called it Rummikub. Accompanied
        with a vision just as bright and as grand as the initial idea, it became an overnight hit. The Hertzano family
        moved to Israel in the 1940’s after World War II, continuing the development on Rummikub in the backyard of his
        house in Bat Yam, and eventually became a professional game developer after publishing it to the market</p>

        How To Play
      </header>
      <p>The game can be played by 2 to 4 people, each of whom draws 14 cards first.</p>

      <p>At the beginning, participants must complete the "Ice Breaker", which means that the total number of cards
        drawn (must comply with the group or sequence rules below) is at least 30. If there is no combination with more
        than 30 points, you need to draw another card and put it on your own card rack. Please note that you can only
        use your own cards to form a deck when breaking the ice. You cannot use cards that others have already played on
        the table. Wild cards can be used to break the ice.</p>

      <p>If the players have broken the ice, they can use their cards to form sequences or groups. You can also combine
        the decks of cards that others have played on the table with your own cards to form a new deck. Each person has
        30 seconds (fast), 60 seconds (normal) or 120 seconds (slow) to think each turn. If you cannot play a card, you
        need to draw a new card.</p>

      <p>The person who finishes playing cards the fastest is the winner. If all the covered cards have been taken away
        but there is no winner, the game ends and the points lost are calculated based on the cards in each person's
        hand.</p>
