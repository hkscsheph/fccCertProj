    <code>+10 Health, +20% Oath Armor, +3 Wildcard Mantra Slots</code>
    <p>This Oath grants the player three extra Wildcard Mantra slots, 10 Health and 20% Oath armor. Oath Armor decreases
      the damage received from all Oath-related attacks,[1] including Mantras and Silentheart abilities.</p>
    <p>Oathless' Oath resistance is actually Oath armor instead, which means it is affected by PEN, is completely
      nullified if you have no armor durability, and is bypassed entirely by Oath abilities that have more than one
      damage typing. This is because when an attack has more than one damage typing, you'll resist that damage based off
      your highest corresponding armor resistance; for example if you had 35% Blunt armor and 30% Thundercall armor,
      you'll resist 35% of Thunder Kick's damage. And so, because every Master Outfit grants more than 20%
      Physical/Elemental armor, depending on what Oath your opponent has, Oathless' 20% Oath armor may do absolutely
      nothing.</p>
    <p>As for its appearance, nothing is added to your outfit, making it impossible to tell if a person has Oathless or
      not, which makes sense because Oathless makes you unbound to an Oath. Unless seen in a Bounty Board.</p>

      <li>20 Flamecharm + 20 Thundercall + 20 FTD</li>
      <p>This Oath grants 1 Wildcard Mantra Slot and 2 Combat Mantra Slots. As for appearance, when casted a suit of
        armor appears around the user. The visor and breastplate both glow yellow. The suit also functions as a dim
        source of light. The suit gives total resistance to parasites and allows you to walk on parasite pools.</p>
      <p>Arcwarder is one of the 16 obtainable Oaths in Deepwoken. It heavily focuses on defense; four of its passives
        are defensive, and the other two are mobility. It still allows for a fair bit of offensive play however as dash
        allows the user to close gaps and maneuver around opponents, and both combat mantras are as effective if not
        more in aggressive play.</p>
      <p>The Arc Suit is a defence orientated piece of semi-sentient armour that the Union bestows upon their most
        trusted. It fuses with the soul of those who swear the oath, allowing them to manifest it around them at will.
        Arcwarders are sworn to become a conduit of protection to their fellow Union mates and do whatever it takes to
        defend them. Notably, Arcwarders are the only people known to utilize Plasma in their attacks, likely from a
        result of the Flamecharm and Thundercall being combined within the suit.</p>

      <li>40 Strength + 1 Player Grip</li>
      <p>This Oath grants 2 Combat Mantra slots and 8 Health. Additionally, the Flamecharm Mantra Fire Blade is modified
        by this Oath, causing the user to periodically rise into the sky, and unleash a screen shaking, heavily
        modified, multi-hitting Fire Blade, several times the size of the original. This effect can be disabled with the
        use of a Reversal Spark. As for appearance, aside from the wings which appear anytime you utilize a starkindred
        mantra, a white collar with 4 spikes connected to it will continuously circle around the user's neck.</p>
      <p>The Starkindred Church is a malevolent cult that worships Celestials and believes that they are capable of
        "transcending" by consuming parts of them. This very Oath is a result of drinking the Holy Ichor, the blood of a
        Celestial, and cannibalizing several Starkindred. Drinking the Ichor Seems to give the consumer some form of
        higher awareness but leaves their body in constant agonizing pain. It is the Celestial equivalent of becoming a
        Deepwoken.</p>

      <li>75 Weapon, 25 Strength, 25 Charisma OR Agility</li>
      <p>Silentheart is one of the 16 obtainable Oaths. It sacrifices Mantras and Attunements as a whole in exchange for
        the ability to change weapons during battle and a unique set of attacks integrated into your moveset.</p>
      <p>Silentheart is a result of a Vow made with The Dreadstar, a mysterious entity residing in the Voidsea made from
        the souls of various deceased individuals. Vengeful due to its death at the hands of the users of Mantras, it
        falsely believes it can rewire the hearts of those willing to engage in a Vow with it to avoid using the Song.
        Upon the Silentheart reaching their true potential, the Dreadstar fuses with them to form a single entity.
        Unfortunately, the Song is so permeating that the Silentheart is only able to sidestep the Mantras that killed
        them; their newfound abilities too rely on the Song. Had it truly become disconnected, the Silentheart would
        have become an ordinary human being with little strength or durability, akin to a Lightkeeper and their
        inability to use the Song. The Dreadstar references a "Keeper," implying it to have connections to Yunâ€™Shul.</p>

      <li>20 Flamecharm, Thundercall, Frostdraw, Galebreathe, Shadowcast (ya five magic)</li>
      <p>Saintsworn is an Oath relating to the usage of multiple attunements, and Hero's Blades. It allows you to
        harness the power of the souls of the Five Heroes and wield their abilities in combat with their souls watching
        over your strife.</p>
      <p>The Five Heroes were considered to be the Saints of their respective attunements back in times of old. Wishing
        to carry on their legacy after they met their fate, they would make a Vow to infuse their souls into swords
        after their demise, turning into Hero Blades. The player, upon swearing the Oath, vows to carry on their legacy
        with the Heroes themselves watching over them.</p>
      <code>but this oath can add other magic and this is really hard to use for it to play, you must to have a good combo</code>
