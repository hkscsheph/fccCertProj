      <p><span> FC Barcelona Futsal.</span>utbol Club Barcelona commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça
        ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the
        top flight of Spanish football.

        Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has
        become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club").[2]
        Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable
        football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of
        revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça",
        written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and
        garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

        Barcelona are one of the world's most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 80 trophies: 28
        La Liga, 32 Copa del Rey, 2 Copa de la Liga, 15 Supercopa de España and 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, as well as
        being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barça has won 22
        European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a record
        three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups and three FIFA Club World
        Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club
        World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as
        of May 2023.[9][10][11] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams
        are referred to as El Clásico.

        Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social
        media followings in the world among sports teams.[12][13] Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve
        Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the
        Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three
        players who came through the club's youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three
        best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football
        academy.[14][15] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe
        awards.[16]

        Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top
        division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[17][18] In 2009, Barcelona
        became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA
        Champions League titles, and also became the first European football club to win six competitions in a single
        year, by also triumphing in the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[19] In 2011, the club
        became European champions again, winning five trophies.[20] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in
        just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all
        time.[21][22][23] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became
        the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[24]</p>

      <p><span>who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina
          national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for
          individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d'Or awards and
          eight times being named the world's best player by FIFA.[note 2] He is the most decorated player in the
          history of professional football having won 45 team trophies,[note 3] including twelve Big Five league titles,
          four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most
          European Golden Shoes (6), most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672, with
          Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most assists (18) and goal
          contributions (32) in the Copa América, most goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international
          appearances (191) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter
          category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals
          and has provided over 380 assists for club and country.</p>

    <section id="Real_Madrid" class="main-section">
      <header>Real Madrid</header>
      <p><span>Hello world</span> Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home
        kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King
        Alfonso XIII in 1920 along with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the
        85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's
        members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the
        "Hala Madrid y nada más", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported
        in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory
        as of 2024.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable
        football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid became the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue
        according to the club's announcement.[12]

        Real Madrid are one of the most successful football clubs in the world and most successful in Europe. In
        domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de
        España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35
        trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a
        joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World
        championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked joint first a record number of times in the International Federation of
        Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) Club World Ranking for the years 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2024.[17] In
        UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19]

        Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since
        its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries,
        most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself
        as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and
        six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front,
        with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás,
        Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real
        Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo,
        Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers
        to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought
        in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is
        Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed
        Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's
        all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently focused on signing young talents such as Vinícius
        Júnior, Rodrygo, and Jude Bellingham.[29]

        Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European
        club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in
        2004.[31] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/EUFA Champions League (55),[18] a
        tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[32] Real
        Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/EUFA Champions
        League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the
        first and the only club to win La Décima (in 2013–14).[33] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th
        Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[34] Real
        Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As
        of February 2025, Real Madrid are ranked 1st in Europe, according to the UEFA club rankings as well as first in
        last 10 years (2013–2023) overall..</p>
